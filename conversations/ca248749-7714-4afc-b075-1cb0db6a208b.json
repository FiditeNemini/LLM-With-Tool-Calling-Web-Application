Model Architecture: This is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. After pretraining, this model uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference training to align model behavior to human preferences for helpfulness and safety. The model features three layers with sliding window attention (window size 4096) and ROPE for efficient local context modeling and relative positional encoding. A fourth layer uses global attention without positional embeddings, enabling unrestricted token interactions across the entire sequence. Languages covered: The model has been trained on 23 languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Czech, Indonesian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek, Hindi, Hebrew, and Persian. Context length: Command R7B supports a context length of 128K. Command R7B excels on standardized and externally verifiable benchmarks such as the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. Compared to other similarly sized open-weights models, Command R7B ranks first with strong performance across all tasks. HuggingFace Leaderboard evaluation results. Competitor numbers are taken from the official leaderboard. Command R7B results are calculated by us using the official HuggingFace prompts and evaluation code. Command R7B can be configured as both a conversational model and an instruct model. The conversational mode conditions the model on interactive behaviour, meaning it is expected to reply in a conversational fashion, provides introductory statements and follow-up questions, and uses Markdown as well as LaTeX where appropriate. It is optimized for interactive experiences, such as chatbots, where the model engages in dialogue. The instruct mode, in contrast,'}, {'url': 'https://ollama.com/library/command-r7b', 'citation': '872 Pulls Updated yesterday Updated yesterday yesterday bb9fe394b3e9 \u00b7 5.1GB Note: this model requires Ollama 0.5.5 which is currently in prerelease C4AI Command R7B is an open weights research release of a 7B billion parameter model with advanced capabilities optimized for a variety of use cases including reasoning, summarization, question answering, and code.
