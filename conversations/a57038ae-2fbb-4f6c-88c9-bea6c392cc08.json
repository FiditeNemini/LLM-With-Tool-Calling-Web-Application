LLMs use deep learning to understand content and then perform tasks such as content summarization and generation, and they make predictions based on their input and training.\\nLLMs can be trained on more than one petabyte of data. For reference, a one-gigabyte document can contain approximately 180 million words. A petabyte can contain one million gigabytes worth of data.\\nThe rigorous LLM training process enables applications and platforms to understand and generate content including text, audio, images, and synthetic data. Most popular LLMs are general-purpose models that are pre-trained and then fine-tuned to meet specific needs.\\nLLMs require an extensive training and fine-tuning process before they can deliver reliable and useful results (although they have several limitations). In many cases, professionals across industries, including marketing and sales teams, use pre-trained LLMs that are provided by organizations that dedicate a wealth of resources to create and maintain the LLM (see the section below for examples of popular LLMs).\\nThe following high-level steps are required to train and fine-tune an LLM:\\nLarge language models can be used to accomplish many tasks that would commonly take humans a lot of time, such as text generation, translation, content summary, rewriting, classification, and sentiment analysis. LLMs can also power chatbots, which enable customers to ask questions and seek help or resources without entering a support queue.\\nPeople can engage with LLMs through a conversational AI platform that allows them to ask questions or provide commands \u2014 a process known as prompt engineering \u2014 for the LLM to fulfill.\\nIt\u2019s important to note that LLMs should not replace humans (see the section below on LLM limitations). Instead, LLMs augment and accelerate human productivity, can help people overcome writer\u2019s block, and handle mundane or repetitive tasks to free humans up to pursue other important or creative endeavors. LLMs can also generate campaign recommendations for composable CDPs directly from customer data and allow for customized marketing strategies.\\nMarketing teams can leverage LLMs and AI-powered tools to accelerate their content creation workflows and support various elements of the customer journey. LLMs are powerful for streamlining marketing processes, managing brand reputation, and improving customer support response times. This value is especially helpful if an organization lacks internal resources or manages a large volume of customer interactions.\\nLLMs enable generative marketing strategies and power generative marketing platforms. A few marketing use cases for LLMs include:\\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more, this webinar replay further explains how generative AI can be used to enable and improve the above use cases.\\nThere are several different types of large language models based on how they are trained. Common LLM types include:\\nThere are several key components of large language models that orchestrate requests and generate responses to a prompt. The following are the key LLM components:\\nThere are many acronyms and terms related to artificial intelligence and large language models that are commonly misunderstood or confused with one another.\\nLarge language models are a specific class of AI models designed to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs specifically refer to AI models trained on text and can generate textual content. All LLMs are a type of generative AI.\\nGenerative AI is a broad category of AI encompassing a range of multimodal models that can create new content, including text, images, videos, and more.\\nBoth LLMs and generative AI can be built with a transformer architecture (represented with the \u2018T\u2019 in ChatGPT). Transformers effectively capture contextual information and long-range dependencies, making them especially helpful for various language tasks. Transformers can also be used to generate images and other types of content.\\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a broad field focused on the interaction between computers and language. NLP refers to the ability of computers to interpret, understand, and generate human language. NLP enables text understanding, language translation, speech recognition, and text generation.\\nLLMs are a subset of NLP and are specific classes of models that include NLP capabilities and enable similar functions. LLMs are also used to improve NLP outputs.\\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) refers to a family of LLMs created by OpenAI that are built on a transformer architecture. GPT is a specific example of an LLM, but there are other LLMs available (see below for a section on examples of popular large language models).\\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) is a type of AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a range of tasks with performance that is comparable to human intelligence. AGI is also called \u201chuman-level AI,\u201d and experts frequently debate whether AGI is achievable and if it\u2019s helpful or harmful to society. LLMs are more focused on specific tasks than AGI.\\nLLMs present several advantages for data engineers and everyday practitioners, including:\\nDespite the clear advantages of LLMs, users should consider several challenges and limitations.\\nThere are many popular large language models. Some LLMs are open source, meaning users can access the full source code, training data, and architecture. Other LLMs are proprietary, which are owned by a company or entity that can limit how the LLM is used, and only customers can access the LLM.\\nEach model offers different benefits or advantages, such as being trained on larger datasets, enhanced capabilities for common sense reasoning and mathematics, and differences in coding. While earlier LLMs focused primarily on NLP capabilities, new LLM advancements have introduced multimodal capabilities for both inputs and outputs.\\nA few popular LLMs include:\\nSupercharge your favorite marketing and sales tools with intelligent customer audiences built in BigQuery, Snowflake, or Redshift.'}",
